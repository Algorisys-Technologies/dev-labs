NumPy provides specialized functions designed to read large datasets directly into high-performance memory structures:
np.loadtxt(): Used for simple, clean text or CSV files where every row has the same number of values.
np.genfromtxt(): A more flexible version that handles "messy" data, such as missing values or varied data types.
np.load(): Used for loading data that has already been saved in NumPy’s native .npy or .npz binary formats, which is significantly faster than reading text files. 
2. How Python would do it without NumPy
Without NumPy, you would have to rely on Python’s built-in csv module or manual file handling. The process would look like this:
Open the file: Use open('data.csv').
Iterate line by line: Use a for loop to read each line as a string.
Split and Clean: Manually split strings by commas and strip whitespace.
Manual Type Casting: Explicitly convert every single string (e.g., "1.5") into a float or integer one by one.
Store in a List of Lists: Save these converted values into a standard Python list. 
3. Why NumPy is so much more useful
The difference between the two approaches is not just about writing less code; it’s about how the computer's hardware processes the information.
Speed (The "C" Advantage): NumPy is written in C and Fortran. While a standard Python loop "interprets" every line—checking types and searching for memory—NumPy executes its loading loops at the hardware level, often performing 10x to 100x faster.
Memory Efficiency:
Python Lists: Act like "boxes containing pointers" scattered across your RAM. Each number in a list is a full-blown "object" with extra overhead.
NumPy Arrays: Store data contiguously (side-by-side) in a single block of memory. This can reduce memory usage by up to 80% or more for large datasets.
Vectorization: Once data is loaded into NumPy, you can perform math on the whole dataset at once (e.g., data * 2) instead of writing another for loop. This allows the CPU to use SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) to process multiple numbers in a single clock cycle.
