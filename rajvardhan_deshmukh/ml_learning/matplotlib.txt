Matplotlib serves as the primary engine for converting data from raw numbers into visual stories. While NumPy organizes the data, Matplotlib renders it.
1. How Matplotlib is Used to Display Data
Matplotlib works by mapping numerical values to physical coordinates on a "canvas."
The Workflow: You pass lists or NumPy arrays into a plotting function (like plt.plot() or plt.scatter()). Matplotlib automatically calculates the necessary axis scales, draws the points or lines, and renders the result.
Components: It treats a chart as a hierarchy of objects:
Figure: The overall window or page.
Axes: The area where your data actually appears.
Artists: Everything else you see—titles, legends, and gridlines. 
2. How Python Would Do It Without Matplotlib
Without a visualization library, Python has no built-in way to "draw" graphs. You would be forced to use one of two primitive methods:
Text-Based "Graphs": You would have to write complex for loops to print characters like * or o in specific positions on your terminal screen to mimic a shape.
Manual SVG/Image Generation: You would need to manually write the raw code for an image file (like an .svg or .bmp file), defining every single pixel's color and coordinate from scratch—a task that would take hundreds of lines of code for even a simple bar chart. 
3. Why It Is Useful
One-Line Visualization: What would take days of manual pixel-drawing can be done in one command: plt.hist(data).
Granular Control: In 2026, it remains the "gold standard" for academic and professional reports because you can customize every tiny detail—from font sizes to specific line thicknesses—to meet strict publication standards.
The Ecosystem Foundation: Most other "fancy" Python charting tools (like Seaborn or Pandas' own .plot() function) are actually just wrappers built on top of Matplotlib. Learning Matplotlib gives you the keys to understand almost all other Python visualization tools.
Publication Quality: It can export your work into high-resolution formats like PDF or SVG, ensuring your charts look crisp whether they are on a smartphone screen or printed in a textbook.
