    "1) **NumPy** is used in Python primarily for efficient numerical computing, specifically for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays (called ndarrays) and matrices. It provides a high-performance alternative to standard Python lists for mathematical and scientific operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Pandas** (Python Data Analysis Library) is a popular open-source Python library used for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, primarily focusing on structured, tabular data like spreadsheets or SQL tables. It offers powerful features for data manipulation, cleaning, exploring, and transforming, making it a fundamental building block for data science, machine learning, and general data work in Python, with key structures like the DataFrame (2D) and Series (1D).\n",
    "Key Functions & Uses\n",
    "Data Manipulation: Merging, joining, reshaping, and filtering datasets.\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and correcting errors.\n",
    "Data Analysis: Performing statistical analysis, finding correlations, and calculating averages, max, and min values.\n",
    "Input/Output: Reading and writing data from various formats like CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.\n",
    "Time Series: Specific tools for handling time-stamped data.\n",
    "Core Data Structures\n",
    "DataFrame: A 2D, labeled data structure with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "Series: A 1D labeled array, like a single column in a DataFrame.\n",
    "Why Use Pandas?\n",
    "Efficiency: Provides fast and flexible ways to work with large datasets.\n",
    "Simplifies Complex Tasks: Makes data analysis intuitive and less code-intensive.\n",
    "Foundation for Other Tools: Often used alongside other libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for broader data science tasks.\n",
    "3) **matplotlib**: For drawing graphs. \n",
    "4) **scikit-learn**: For running ML algorithms. It has many ml algorithms which we can use it by calling the class name and creating an object of it. \n",
