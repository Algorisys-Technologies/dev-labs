    "Goal: Set up the professional environment required for Machine Learning. We move beyond simple Python scripts to interactive data science tools.\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)\n",
    "• What it is: Unlike standard Python files (.py), Jupyter Notebooks allow you to mix live code, visualizations (graphs), and explanatory text (Markdown) in one document.\n",
    "• Why we use it: It is the industry standard for communicating data science projects. It allows you to tell a story with your data rather than just writing raw code.\n",
    "• Setup: You installed the Jupyter extension in VS Code to run these notebooks directly in your editor.\n",
    "2. The Three \"God-Tier\" Libraries\n",
    "You cannot write ML code from scratch every time. We installed three fundamental libraries:\n",
    "1. NumPy (import numpy as np): The fundamental package for scientific computing. It handles arrays and matrices much faster than standard Python lists. It is essential for linear algebra.\n",
    "2. Scikit-Learn (import sklearn): The most popular library for Machine Learning. It contains pre-built algorithms (like classification, regression, clustering) and tools for data splitting.\n",
    "3. Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt): The plotting library. We use this to draw graphs, scatter plots, and visualize our decision boundaries.\n"
